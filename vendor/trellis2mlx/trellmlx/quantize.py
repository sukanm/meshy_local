"""Quantize trellis2mlx flow-model Linear layers.

MLX's INT4 quantization reduces flow-model weight memory ~6.4x
(5.17GB -> 0.81GB). It is useful for packaging and tighter memory budgets, but
there was no measured M2 Pro speedup in the current stage benchmark.

Usage:
    from trellmlx.quantize import quantize_model
    quantize_model(model, bits=4)  # in-place quantization
